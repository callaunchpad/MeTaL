## Virtual Environments and Dependencies
We strongly encourage building dependencies within a virtual environment. To use the Python virtual environments, follow [this guide on python environments](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/), or to use Conda environments, follow [this guide on conda environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

Once inside your environment, from the base directory of this repo, run
'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''
This should add any required dependencies to your virtual environment.
